        <b>Crown shyness</b> (also
        <i>canopy disengagement</i>,<sup>[1]</sup>
        <i>canopy shyness</i>,<sup>[2]</sup> or
        <i>inter-crown spacing </i><sup>[3]</sup>) is
        a phenomenon observed in some tree species, 
        in which the crowns of fully stocked trees 
        do not touch each other, forming a canopy
        with channel-like gaps.<sup>[4][5]</sup>
        The phenomenon is most prevalent among trees
        of the same species, but also occurs between
        trees of different species.<sup>[6][7]</sup>
        There exist many hypotheses as to why crown 
        shyness is an adaptive behavior, and research
        suggests that it might inhibit spread of
        leaf-eating insect larvae.<sup>[8]</sup>

        The exact physiological basis of crown shyness 
        is uncertain
        <sup>[6]</sup>
        The phenomenon has
        been discussed in scientific literature since
        the 1920s.<sup>[9]</sup> The variety of hypotheses
        and experimental results might suggest that there 
        are multiple mechanisms across different species,
